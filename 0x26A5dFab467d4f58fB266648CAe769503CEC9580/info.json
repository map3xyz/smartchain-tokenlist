    "en": "Benchmark Protocol mitigates liquidation events and hedges risk with the MARK token; a supply elastic, stablecoin-alternative. The protocol dynamically adjusts supply based on the CBOE volatility index (VIX) and deviations from 1 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) unit. xMARK represents a share of MARK that is deposited in a token pool affected by rebasements, while xMARK itself is unaffected."
