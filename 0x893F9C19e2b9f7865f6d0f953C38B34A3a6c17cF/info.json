    "en": "BTCR token is a community based project that enables cashless payment procedures via a secure blockchain connection with provenance. In future, Bitcoin Reflect can be used to buy goods online with crypto including products on eBay, amazon and etsy. Investors can profit from a decreasing supply that accumulates new tokens with every processed BTCR transaction. That results in more BTCR tokens directly processed as passive income into their own wallet, while the circulating supply decreases."
