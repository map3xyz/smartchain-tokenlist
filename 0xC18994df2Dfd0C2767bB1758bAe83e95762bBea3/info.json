    "en": "ElonPeg presents a new financial model for the now-common deflationary token: automated burn pegged to the Twitter account of the one and only Elon. Our system is unique, combining outside If-This-Then-That style API calls to scour Twitter regularly, highly secure serverless compute resources to take blockchain requests, and a unique BurnUponTweeting contract to transparently execute a 0.5% burn upon tweeting, rewarding holders with reflections and diminishing supply to hedge against volatility."
