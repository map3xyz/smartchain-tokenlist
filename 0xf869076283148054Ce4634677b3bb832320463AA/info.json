    "en": "DADDY FEG token will serve as a launchpad for legitimate organizations and projects in the De-Fi Binance Smart Chain space. Tokens who want to be featured on the DADDY FEG token site will need to pay to become partners and be promoted. The launchpad serves the purpose of weeding out illegitimate projects and confirming project activity with team leaders. Any projects found to be associated with projects that failed early will automatically be rejected, due to a poor track record."
